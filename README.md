## HaltonDraws

Convenient interface for getting Halton Draws from a Normal distribution. Typically needed for Monte Carlo integration. These are rough implementations of the code available [Kolář and O'Shea (1993) ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229173824_Fast_portable_and_reliable_algorithm_for_the_calculation_of_Halton_numbers) and make no claim of coding efficiency or deep understanding.

`HaltonDraws!{T<:AbstractFloat}(H::Vector{T}, B::Int, [skip::Int=0, distr=Normal()])` replaces `H` with draws from `distr` using a Halton sequence of base `B` after discarding `skip` entries.

Also exports `HaltonSeq!{T<:AbstractFloat}(H::Vector{T}, B::Int; skip::Int=0)` which replaces `H` with entries from a Halton sequence of base `B` after discarding `skip` entries.

##### To-Do:

* Add ability to use every $k$-th draw.
